# Advanced iOS AT2 - Budgeting App

# GITHUB [LINK] (Link here)

## Dependencies
The only package dependency neccessary to run this app is Firebase/Firestore.

The package should load automatically, however, if it doesn't', install with the Swift package manager with the following link [LINK] (https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git)

## Primary Functionality
 - Login and registration functionality with authentication and account creation through Firebase
 
 ## Reflection
 
 - A budgeting goals feature. A basic view was made but not enough time was available to fully flesh the feature out.
 - Better information summarisation
