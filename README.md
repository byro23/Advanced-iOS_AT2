# Advanced iOS AT2 - Budgeting App

# GITHUB [LINK](https://github.com/byro23/Advanced-iOS_AT2)

## Dependencies
The only package dependency neccessary to run this app is Firebase/Firestore.

The package should load automatically, however, if it doesn't', install with the Swift package manager with the following link [LINK](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git)

## Primary Functionality
 - Login and registration functionality with authentication and account creation through Firebase / Firestore
 
 - User dashboard 
 (Homeview) which summarises and user transaction data. Transactions are categorised and displayed on a pie chart to improve information assimilation.
 
 - Transaction view which can be filtered my any transaction property. From this screen the user can add a new transaction.
 
 - Category view which lists all categories in alphabetical order and can be removed with swipe gesture.
 
 - Seamless navigation utilising a navigation controller which provides navigation updates to navigation stack and tab view.
 
 ## Reflection
 
 If more time were available, I would make the transactions and categories editable. Furthermore, I would add a 'budget goals' feature which would allow users to set targets and contribute to the goal over time. It would also provide a deadline to keep users motivated. A preview of what this feature would look like can be seen in the components directory of the project in 'GoalCardView' file.
